    define various security roles that will apply to the system they administer. Once roles
    have been defined the Jenkins administrator can assign those roles to groups of users.
    The assignment of roles can take place either at the global level, or limited to specific
    objects within the system. And, additionally, the Jenkins administrator can even
    delegate the management of groups for specific objects to specific users.</l:description></l:dependency></l:dependencies>
