Specification-Title: The Role-Based Access Control plugin gives a Jenk
 ins administrator the ability to
     define various security roles that will apply to the system they 
 administer. Once roles
     have been defined the Jenkins administrator can assign those role
 s to groups of users.
     The assignment of roles can take place either at the global level
 , or limited to specific
     objects within the system. And, additionally, the Jenkins adminis
 trator can even
     delegate the management of groups for specific objects to specifi
 c users.
