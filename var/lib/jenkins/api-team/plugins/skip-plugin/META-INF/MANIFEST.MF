Specification-Title: This plugin allows jobs to be temporarily disable
 d for a fixed period of time. After the fixed period the job will aut
 omatically be re-enabled.
     This is usually useful in scenarios when teams are making a lot o
 f changes that are known to make the repository unstable for a period
  of time. Instead of dealing with false errors, the job can be disabl
 ed and automatically woken up.
