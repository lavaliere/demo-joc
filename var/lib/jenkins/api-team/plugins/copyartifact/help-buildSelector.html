  How to select the build to copy artifacts from, such as latest successful
  or stable build, or latest "keep forever" build.  Other plugins may provide
  additional selections. <br/>
  The build number of the selected build will be recorded in the environment
  for later build steps to reference.  The name of the environment variable
  is <tt>COPYARTIFACT_BUILD_NUMBER_</tt> with the source project name appended
  (in all uppercase, and sequences of characters other than A-Z replaced by a 
  single underscore).
  <p><strong>Example</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The build number of the build for the source project <code>Project-ABC</code> is
      available in <code>COPYARTIFACT_BUILD_NUMBER_PROJECT_ABC</code></li>
    <li>
      The build number of the build for the source project <code>tool1-release1.2</code> is
      available in <code>COPYARTIFACT_BUILD_NUMBER_TOOL_RELEASE_</code></li>
  </ul>
